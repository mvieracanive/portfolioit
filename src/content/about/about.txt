My name is Maia Viera Cañive, I graduated from college in 2008 in Cuba. I studied in University “Marta Abreu de Las Villas” 5 years a major in Computer Sciences and 2 more years of advanced postgraduate courses mostly in Computer Sciences too.  I ended a master in a design of a nationwide environmental information infrastructure using REST principles. I can assure that meeting client’s expectations is one of my priorities. If there is a problem compromising the successful result of a project I would be pleased to help even if the the origin is outside my responsibilities.
All my professional life I have been working in programming. I started with .Net desktop applications for a short time and then life took me to web technologies and I have been there for a long time now. Currently, I am developing supporting applications using RESTful APIs for the Telecomunication Company Etecsa. What I like the most is product analysis but, coding good designs is also a satisfaction. My various experience allows me to catch new concepts or technologies fast. I would like to add to my records that I have experience working as freelancer internationally for more than 8 years.
